TRoLE: Taylor Relaxation Of Loop Ensembles
------------------------------------------

The loops are represented as force-free fields with piece-wise constant alpha profiles before onset of linear instability
and with linear alpha profiles after helicity-conserving Taylor relaxation. A loop can also be described by a smooth alpha profile.

This code was used to generate the results presented in two papers.

Version 1.0 of the TRoLE code uses the NAG C library, whereas v2.0, the current version, uses the GNU Scientific Library.


The following commands assume that the user is in the trole directory with the source code in ./trole/src.
Also, GNU Scientific Library v1.16 must be installed in the default locations (i.e., /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include/gsl).


1. Setting up the TRoLE environment...

source ./env.sh


2. Compiling TRoLE from within emacs...

emacs makefile &
M-x compile
make -C ./bin/trole


3. Debugging TRoLE from within emacs...

M-x gdb
gdb --annotate=3 ./bin/trole

run ./data/input/exm.txt
